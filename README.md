# Pi-Developer-Documentation
I plan to enhance and build upon the current Pi Network documentation and possibly build some new SDKs.

## [Checklist](checklist.md)
A great place to start to ensure all the steps are done correctly in order to get your app to production.

## [Server API](server-api.md)
Documentation to access the Pi Network using the API to access pioneer, payments, and wallet information from your server.

## [Platform SDK](platform-sdk.md)
The SDK is a developer’s method to interact with and obtain information from the Pi Servers in your app. Developers can request information such as a Pioneer’s username or create a payment within Pi Browser.
